## Running Tests

The tests use [pytest](https://pytest.org/). To run them, install `pytest` and then execute:

```bash
pytest
```

This runs the test suite in the `tests/` directory, including `tests/test_html_validity.py` which checks that `index.html` parses without errors and includes the AI-generated disclaimer comment.
